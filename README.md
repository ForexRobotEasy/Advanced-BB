## Advanced BB Forex

This code is an example of a trading strategy implemented in MQL5 language. It is a part of the Advanced BB Forex software developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. Please note that ForexRobotEasy is not the official developer of this product, and to find the official developer, you should use MQL5.

### Product Description

The Advanced BB Forex software is designed to take advantage of high volatility in the forex market. It uses Bollinger Bands and Average True Range (ATR) indicators to identify price imbalances and make trading decisions. The software implements two main strategies: trade entry based on volatility increase and ATR alignment, and mean reversion in high volatility and no trend conditions.

#### Volatility Increase and ATR Alignment Strategy

The software checks for a volatility increase and ATR alignment to enter a trade. It first performs Bollinger Band analysis to identify price imbalances. The upper band, middle band, and lower band values are calculated using the iBands function. If the current price is above the upper band, the software calculates the ATR value using the iATR function. If the ATR value exceeds a pre-set threshold, the strategy considers the volatility to be increased and ATR to be aligned.

#### Trade Entry

When the volatility increase and ATR alignment conditions are met, the software executes the trade entry logic. The maximum loss per trade is calculated based on the account balance and the Loss_Percent input parameter. Stop loss and take profit levels are determined, and a buy order is placed using the OrderSend function.

#### High Volatility and No Trend Strategy

The software also implements a mean reversion strategy in high volatility and no trend conditions. It checks if the ATR value exceeds a pre-set threshold to determine high volatility. The no trend condition is not specified in the code and needs to be implemented separately. If both conditions are met, the mean reversion strategy is implemented.
